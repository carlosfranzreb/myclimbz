                    I started climbing indoors in 2019. I had been wanting to try for a while, but the gym membership was too expensive.
                    That year, the company I worked for offered a discount, so I decided to try it out. Needless to say, I got hooked.
                    Almost two years later, I tried bouldering outside for the first time. It was in Chironico, Switzerland, and it was a blast.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Figure 1 shows the number of climbs I've tried over the years. There is a big gap between 2022 and 2023, where I started
                    climbing outside more regularly. Also, a couple of my earlier trips did not make it into the Google Sheet I initially used
                    to log my climbs. Still, the trend is clear: I'm climbing more and more outside. I definitely prefer it to indoor climbing
                    and, as I gain experience, my appreciation for it grows.

                    Figure 2 shows how many attempts I made each year. Naturally, this plot is similar to the one above, as more climbs
                    translates into more attempts. An interesting difference, however, is between the last two years, 2023 and 2024.
                    The difference in attempts between these two years is much bigger than the number of climbs. This means that this
                    year I'm trying more climbs more times. This matches my experience: I've spent more time projecting climbs this year than
                    previously. I can also plot the avg. number of attempts I've spent on each climb. The avg. for 2023 is 4.6, while for 2024
                    it is 5.4. I expect this difference to grow in the next years, as I focus more on projecting.

                    Grades are a controversial topic. Most climbers take them too seriously, but they are still a good way to track progress.
                    The point is that they are easily plotted. Figure 3 shows the max. grade I sent each year. As I only started climbing recently,
                    there is not much to discuss here, but it will be interesting to see how this plot evolves over the years. I don't have a particular
                    goal in mind; I just like climbing at my limit, and my limit will likely improve over time.
